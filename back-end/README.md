# ArchGemini back-end

## Getting Started

```bash
# To install required dependencies.
npm i
```

```bash
# To run the build process.
npm run build
```

```bash
# To run the server using nodemon.
npm run test
```

```bash
# To run the server.
npm start
```

After you run the `test` or `start` command, `ArchGemini Sender` will automatically open. If it does not, then you can also manually open the link, which will be logged on the console based on your local IP and available port.
